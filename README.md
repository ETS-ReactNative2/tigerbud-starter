# &nbsp; Tigerbud Starter

#### :star: &nbsp; Star us on GitHub â€” it helps!

Tigerbud is an essential starter kit to rapidly build mobile applications supported by modern, scalable, serverless AWS technologies. For beginners and professionals alike, for those who want to experiment, to learn and for those who already know enough, but want to give their budding project a head start.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependancies

Our first step is to ensure that the Amplify CLI is installed globally. Full instructions can be found [here](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install)

```
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

### Initialise Project

To initialise a new project from the tigerbud starter repository run the following command:
```
amplify init --app git@github.com:tigerspike/tigerbud-starter.git
```

This will deploy a new amplify project into an enviroment named `sampledev`. 

To access your new environment run:

```
amplify console
```
### Troubleshooting

If you attempt to initialise many new applications into the same account you may get a clash of resource names due to the environment always being set to `sampledev`. To recover your project run the following to specify an new env name and re-deploy.

```
amplify env add
amplify push
```
This should now deploy a new app environment under the specified name. You can now clean up the environment named `sampledev` by running

```
amplify env remove sampledev
```

## What do you get?
