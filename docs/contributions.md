# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the TigerBud Project!
You can contribute by submitting a bug, creating pull requests or even by improving documentation. Beneath is the manual to be accompanied strictly earlier than submitting your pull requests / issues.

## Roles

### Maintainers

Maintainer form the core product team that ensure product decisions are strategically aligned and that the product is of high quality.

A maintainer is someone who feels responsibility over the direction of the project and is committed to improving it, someone who feels a sense of ownership and is invested in the projects success.

A maintainer doesnâ€™t necessarily have to be someone who writes code for the project but would be responsible for assuring quality and suitability of changes to documentation and code.

Practically this would require maintainers to triage bugs and featues requests and to review pull requests and approve them to be merged into an upcoming release candidate. It is important to note that PR's will not always be technical in nature and that they may relate to documentation, public website and branding or design as well as the product code.

Maintainers would be expected to be pro-active in responding to pull requests with thorough reviews ensuring the PR checklist is met. They would need to be engaged in conversation on github issues with other maintainers and contributors from both TS and the wider open source community.

A maintainer would be expected to act as a subject matter expert for their local team supporting both engineering and commercial in identifying suitable use cases for the product.

Support from the maintainer team will be given to onboard any nominated maintainer to ensure they have a clear view of the product strategy.

Maintainers will also have the authority to approve the addition / removal of other maintainers from the core team.

### Contributers

The role of a contributor is looser and can effectively be anyone, internal or external, who would like to request a new feature, report a bug or to change the product code.

Contributors include any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request. They do not have the authority to accept any change and do not have write access to the project.

### Review Checklist

## Coding Style

To keep project away from disputes we make use of ESLint, which is really a handy linting tool that enforces strict coding styles and makes sure your files are free from dead code.

``` bash
cd NameOfProject
yarn lint
```
