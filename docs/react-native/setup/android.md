# Folow these instructions for Android

[Getting started with React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

Open the simulator. Then run:

```bash
yarn react-native run-android
cd android && ./gradlew clean
cd .. && yarn react-native run-android
```

If still not working need go to Android Studio, open the project, update the stuff they ask for and run the project from there.
